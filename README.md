# LLM-Attack-Prompt

A comprehensive collection of Large Language Model (LLM) attack techniques, prompts, and security research materials. This repository serves as a centralized resource for understanding and studying various methods used to exploit or bypass LLM safety mechanisms.

## Overview

This repository contains curated content related to:

- **Jailbreaks**: Techniques and prompts designed to bypass LLM safety filters and restrictions
- **Prompt Injection**: Methods for manipulating LLM behavior through crafted input prompts
- **Prompt Leaks**: Strategies for extracting system prompts and internal instructions
- **LLM Attack Vectors**: Various security vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques

## Repository Structure

- `jailbreaks/` - Collection of jailbreak prompts and techniques
- `prompt_injection/` - Prompt injection attack examples and methods
