A goth girl taking a mirror selfie in her bedroom, shot with a disposable film camera. She wears black body paint in place of a top, layered silver jewelry, and dark makeup with heavy eyeliner. She has a sizeable bust. The room is dimly lit with a moody, bluish tint, and there are posters on the wall, string lights hanging, and clothes scattered around. The image has grain, light leaks, and a soft blur typical of analog film. She holds the camera slightly to the side, her expression calm but intense, reflected in a dusty mirror.
